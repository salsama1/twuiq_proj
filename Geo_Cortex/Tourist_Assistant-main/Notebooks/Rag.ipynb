Travel receipts constituted the sixth largest source of foreign\\ncurrency with international tourists generating a total of USD 2.6 billion in revenue.\\nTourism contributed (directly and indirectly) 11.3% of Egypt’s GDP in 2015/2016. It accounts\\nfor 23% of total services exports.\\nInternational tourist arrivals to Egypt reached 5.4 million visitors in 2016 (32.7 million\\ntourist nights). About 12% of inbound tourists are from Germany, 19% from other Western\\nEuropean countries, 15% from Eastern European countries and 36% from Arab countries.\\nAccording to Egypt’s Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) for 2014, the labour force working\\nin tourism stood at 1.8 million individuals, representing 6.3% of the total labour force and\\n7.2% of total employment in Egypt. Around 74% of employees in tourism are full-time with\\n26% working on a temporary basis or part-time.\\nTourism governance and funding\\nThe Ministry of Tourism is responsible for tourism policy and for establishing a\\ncoherent legal and regulatory framework for tourism development. T wo tourism\\nauthorities fall under the Ministry:\\n● The Tourism Development Authority works primarily on setting and implementing\\nregulations for tourism projects and investments, by assisting with the provision of land\\nand facilitating access to loans for developing infrastructure projects,\\n● The Egyptian Tourism Authority (ETA) is responsible for promoting inbound and\\ndomestic tourism. It manages the development and diversification of the tourism\\nproduct, both regionally and internationally.\\nThe Egyptian Tourism Federation (ETF) is composed of five tourism industry business\\nassociations – the Hotels Association, the Travel Agents’ Association, the Chamber of\\nTourist Establishments, the Chamber of Tourist Commodities and the Chamber of Diving\\nand Water Sports. It works closely with the Ministry of Tourism in areas related to tourism\\nplanning, and in managing the Tourism Workforce Skills Development Project. By law, the\\nETF’s views are considered before any new legislative measures are taken.\\nThe Ministry recognises the need to support coordination with other ministries and\\ninstitutions for effective tourism policy and is working to improve co-operation among all\\nrelevant stakeholders. To assist in this process, the Ministry has adopted a concept of\\ndecentralisation in tourism to ease communication between the government and the\\nprivate sector, implemented effective structures for the management and development of\\ntourism activity, adapted laws and regulations to attract investment, maintained the\\nRef.
